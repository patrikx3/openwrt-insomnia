# Ext-root via USB driver Virgin

https://openwrt.org/docs/user-guide/extroot_configuration

* I use 3 partitions
  * /dev/sda1 - the ext root, 100gb
  * /dev/sda2 - swap, 10gb
  * /dev/sda3 - /storage, 390gb

* Move to a new terminal and log in

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.1

sysupgrade -r /tmp/backup-*.tar.gz

opkg update

Possible, this server, rarely, is down, please, hang on for 15-30 minutes and the server will be back up.

All my domains ([patrikx3.com](https://patrikx3.com) and [corifeus.com](https://corifeus.com)) could have minor errors, since I am developing in my free time. However, it is usually stable.

**Note about versioning:** Versions are cut in Major.Minor.Patch schema. Major is always the current year. Minor is either 4 (January - June) or 10 (July - December). Patch is incremental by every build. If there is a breaking change, it should be noted in the readme.
