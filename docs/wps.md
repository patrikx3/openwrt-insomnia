# WPS

https://openwrt.org/docs/user-guide/wifi_configuration#wps_options

It is only working, if only these are built in the firmware: ```hostapd-common wpad-mini```, nothing other like that. If not, it will not work.

There were some changes. So this is how it works with ```21.02.0-rc4```.

Minimal steps needed to get WPS running:

In ```/etc/config/wireless``` it is important in the ```wifi-iface```only in the 2.4 GHZ.

```text
    option wps_pushbutton '1'
```

But you can do it with ```LUCI``` as well.

```bash
opkg update
opkg remove wpad-mini wpad-basic
# if you remove it, it will not work
opkg install wpad hostapd-utils
reboot && exit

# wait about 2 minutes
hostapd_cli -i wlan1 wps_pbc

hostapd_cli wps_pin any $PIN
```

# Debug (not needed)

```bash
reboot && exit

# regenerate the wifi interface
rm -f /etc/config/wireless
wifi config

iw reg get
iw dev
```


## Actual Linksys 3200ACM WPS

Do what it says above. Then on router on the bottom right there is the WPS button. Click for like 3 seconds or more and it will work.

### Example

```text
config wifi-iface 'default_radio1'
	option device 'radio1'
	option network 'lan'
	option mode 'ap'
	option ssid 'your-ssid'
	option key 'your-secret'
	option encryption 'psk2+ccmp'
	option wps_pushbutton '1'

```
