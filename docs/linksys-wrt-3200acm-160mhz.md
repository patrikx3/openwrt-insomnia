# Linksys WRT 3200ACM 160Mhz

You have to find out the channel that in your country was setup with the router is working.
For me, I am Hungarian, but the router is FR based in FRANCE in EUROPE (or European Linksys is usually is FR), the ```100, 120 channel``` is working well, I think upwards channels ```100```.

But for now, it is using the ```radar detection``` and it is changing the channels and it works.

## Check status

```bash
iw reg get
iw dev
```


## This is important

http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/network/wireless/radio0.network1

Below:
```Wireless scurity``` set ```Cipher``` to ```Force CCMP (AES)```.

```bash
reboot && exit
```
or just ```Save and Apply``` in ```LUCI```.
